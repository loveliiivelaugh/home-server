            Private applications are built to maintain privacy and security across commonly used applications and software tools. 
            These applications can allow for personalization and customization beyond what is possible in commercial products. 
            Privatizing application usage gives us the ability to own our data and use it for a variety of personal reasons. 
            Beyond that, many applications carry a financial burden. With private apps we can circumvent these costs.
